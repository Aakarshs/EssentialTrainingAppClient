**Essential Training App -  README**

**Description**

Essential training app is a web app that is intended to quiz students on basic computational physics concepts. Quizzes and question templates are created by an admin. The app generates questions using variables and question templates created by the admin. The admin provides students with hashes that they can use to log in and take quizzes. The app stores data on students, and returns them to the admin.

 

**Installing the app(Not recommended):**

Installing the app will take a lot of steps, which includes installing node, npm, installing the front end, the backend and setting up a local database.

**This is a good starting point:**

**Using the app:**

**Quiz Maker**

**QuizMaker is the most complicated operation. It has 3 basic operations:**

**Creating a Template:**

**This is the most complicated operation.**

Start by selecting a course from the course drop down. Then click on Create Template.

Start by picking a template title. This will be the name of the Template while choosing question types for a quiz.

Next, use the box on the centre of the screen to create questions. Use the Text box to add text, and a variable box to add variables. Variables will be generated by the software. For each variable, pick a minimum and maximum range in the box that pops up on the right

for each new variable introduced. You can remove a variable or Text box by picking clicking on the x on the box.

To input the answer template, use the box on the bottom of the screen. It is the same format as the question box. The answer variables should correspond to the letter of the variable, without a $ sign.

Input functions need to be added in a add function box.

All fields need to be filled out before the form can be submitted. To submit, click on the green save template button. You might have to scroll the the right. If you wish to close, click

close on the left top corner.

**Create a quiz:**

From the QuizMaker screen, Enter a Quiz Title, and select as many templates as required from the template. These are the types of questions that will be asked on the quiz. Some quesiton

templates are built in, and do not need extra input from the admin to be created. The box on the right of each added question template is the range, meaning how many questions a student needs to answer before they pass the category of questions (the question template).

**Publishing a quiz:**

After selecting question templates and range, publish the quiz by clicking on publish quiz.

**Hash Maker:**

Hashes will need to be manually sent to students. There is no simple workaround for this due to FERPA regulations and privacy concerns.

To get the hashes that are registered, go to courses, and select the course. This will give a list of all hashes registered in that course.

From Stats, the admin can see select statistics for students who took the quiz. Total Questions is how many questions the student answered, incorrect answers is the number of wrong answers.
